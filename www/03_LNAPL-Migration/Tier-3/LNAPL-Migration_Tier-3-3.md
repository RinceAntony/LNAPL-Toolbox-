<h3><b> Overview of Mahler et al. (2012) LNAPL Stability Paper </h3></b>

<ul>
<li> “...natural losses of light nonaqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) through dissolution and evaporation can control the overall extent of LNAPL bodies and LNAPL fluxes observed within LNAPL bodies.” </li> 
<li> Uses proof-of-concept sand tank experiment where LNAPL is continually added but LNAPL body stabilizes due to losses via dissolution and evaporation. </li>
<li> At actual LNAPL sites, LNAPL stability is rapidly achieved because of LNAPL losses via NSZD. </li>
<li> Simple design charts are provided to show when LNAPL bodies will stabilize as a function of loading and NSZD rate, but these charts assume a constant LNAPL addition through time (a situation that is extremely infrequent at actual LNAPL sites). </li>
<li> Key point:  “...natural losses of LNAPL can play an important role in governing LNAPL fluxes within LNAPL bodies and the overall extent of LNAPL bodies.” </li>
<li> The Concawe Toolbox Tier 2 model located under the question “How far will the LNAPL migrate?” developed by Andrew Kirkman uses key concepts from this paper to predict how far LNAPL can migrate. </li>

<h3><b> Checklist of Input Data for HSSM </b></h3>

Appendix 3 of the HSSM User’s Guide (<a href="https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=124906" target="_blank">Weaver et al., 1994</a>) lists key input data and provides support for parameter estimation. Key parameters with example values are reproduced below:

Users select one of three general release scenarios to the unsaturated zone and enter either an LNAPL flowrate over a certain time period, a volume of LNAPL released over a certain area, or a constant head of LNAPL in an impoundment.
