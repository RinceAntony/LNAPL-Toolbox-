The Concawe Toolbox includes a new Tool developed by Andrew Kirkman based on LNAPL mass limitations included in the HSSM conceptual model integrated with LNAPL transmissivity relationships and LNAPL removal via Natural Source Zone Depletion (NSZD) using the <a href="https://ngwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2012.00949.x" target="_blank">Mahler et al. (2012)</a> model. This Tier 3 section provides additional information about <a href="https://www.epa.gov/water-research/hydrocarbon-spill-screening-model-hssm-windows-version" target="_blank">HSSM</a> and <a href="https://csee.engr.utexas.edu/research/industrial-affiliates-projects/chemical-enhanced-oil-recovery/ut-chem-simulator" target="_blank">UTCHEM</a>, two tools that can be used to answer the question “How far will the LNAPL migrate?” The 2012 paper by <a href="https://ngwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2012.00949.x" target="_blank">Mahler et al. (2012)</a> presents important findings on how NSZD limits LNAPL migration. Finally, an emerging LNAPL modeling method being developed by GSI’s Dr. Sorab Panday is a promising new approach where LNAPL modeling can be performed using a commonly used groundwater model like MODFLOW.


<h3><b> Overview of HSSM </h3></b>

<ul>
<li>“HSSM” is an acronym for Hydrocarbon Spill Screening Model. </li>
<li> Uses analytical relationships to simulate LNAPL movement. </li>
<li> Simulates vertical LNAPL flow through the unsaturated zone. </li>
<li> Simulates formation and decay of an LNAPL lens at the water table. </li>
<li> Assumes a circular lens that is not affected by a water table slope. </li>
<li> Simulates dissolution of LNAPL constituents and dissolved plume migration. </li>
<li> Older model that requires workarounds to run on 64-bit operating systems like Windows 10. </li>
<li> NSZD cannot be simulated, so that LNAPL spreading predictions in HSSM will overestimate actual spreading. </li>

<h3><b> Overview of UTCHEM </h3></b>

<ul>
<li> University of Texas chemical flood simulator developed for the oil industry. </li>
<li> 3-D finite-difference numerical simulator for NAPL. </li>
<li> Simulates multiphase, multicomponent, variable temperature systems and complex phase behavior. </li>
<li> Accounts for chemical and physical transformations and heterogeneous porous media. </li>
<li> Uses advanced concepts in high-order numerical accuracy and dispersion control and vector and parallel processing. </li>
<li> Extremely powerful model but expensive and can be difficult to run. </li>
<li> Due to its complexity, it is typically only used for more complicated LNAPL/environmental problems. </li>
<li> Can be run either as a stand-alone program or accessed through GMS package (e.g., <a href="https://www.aquaveo.com/software/gms-groundwater-modeling-system-introduction" target="_blank">https://www.aquaveo.com/software/gms-groundwater-modeling-system-introduction</a>) </li>
