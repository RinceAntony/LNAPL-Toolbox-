<h3> Kirkman LNAPL Body Additional Migration Tool </h3>

<h3> What the Model Does </h3>   

This tool calculates the additional distance that the leading edge of an existing LNAPL plume is expected to migrate until it eventually stabilizes in the presence of natural source zone depletion (NSZD). To run the model you need to know three things about your LNAPL body:  1) a representative LNAPL transmissivity from bail down tests or from  transmissivities calculated using the "LNAPL Volume Tier 2 Tool; 2) the measured LNAPL body gradient (the slope of the LNAPL body surface); and 3) the current LNAPL body radius (the model makes a simplifying assumption that the LNAPL body is circular).

<h3> How the Model Works </h3>

The model is based on multiple runs of the Hydrocarbon Spill Screening Model (HSSM; Weaver et al., 1994). For each run, an average LNAPL transmissivity (Tn) and gradient (i) were calculated across the oil lens at different times and for different soil types. These average properties were used as starting conditions to calculate the expected additional growth of an LNAPL body under one of five different NSZD rates using the steady-state relationship for a circular source derived by Mahler (Mahler et al., 2012)<br>

The plot shows the calculated LNAPL body length increase for different average values of LNAPL transmissivity × gradient and piecewise linear fit to the data in the nomograph.<br>

To use the model, enter the current LNAPL transmissivity (in m2/d) (see the bottom of the Tier 3 LNAPL Recovery tab), enter the LNAPL gradient (see Section 5.2.1.4 of the User Manual for a description), and select one of five different representative NSZD rates (see Tier 1 of the NSZD Estimation tab). The estimated additional LNAPL body growth from now will be automatically calculated.  The model is a screening level model and will only give a general indication of the potential increase of the LNAPL body, but it will likely be more accurate than older models, such as HSSM, which do not account for NSZD processes.

<h3> Key Assumptions </h3>  

The model assumes that there is an unlimited source of LNAPL and that the LNAPL flux is constant. This is an experimental model. Incorporation of HSSM (Weaver et al., 1994) and Mahler et al. (2012) represents a non-hysteric methodology where entrapment of LNAPL is ignored and loss rate inputs can account for partitioning and biodegradation losses.<br>

Entrapment of LNAPL has been evaluated (Sookhak Lari et al., 2016; Pasha et al., 2014; Guarnaccia et al., 1997) and demonstrated to slow the rate of LNAPL migration. Current methods to incorporate entrapment require numerical models which are not within the scope of this tool. The lack of incorporating entrapment results in a conservative approach where the upper bound of LNAPL migration extent is estimated. The results of this tool are intended to be used for demonstrating LNAPL body stability by comparing the maximum potential for LNAPL migration to current extent.<br>

The model is useful for estimating the upper bound of LNAPL migration. However, if the calculated LNAPL extent is used in cumulative LNAPL loss and time to depletion estimates then the resulting estimates would overestimate losses and underestimate time to depletion (Sookhak Lari et al., 2016). It is appropriate to use current delineated LNAPL body extent for cumulative loss calculations or time to depletion estimates.
