<h4> 
The potential for LNAPL expansion is an important consideration when managing the risk from LNAPL at LNAPL sites.  Some key conventions/concepts are: <br><br>
<ul>
<li> LNAPL experts typically call the LNAPL mass an “<b>LNAPL Body</b>” to prevent any confusion with a dissolved hydrocarbon plume that may be generated by the LNAPL.  The phrase “LNAPL plume” should be avoided. </li>
<li> LNAPL bodies need energy (pressure) to force the LNAPL at the leading edge of the LNAPL body into the pore space of the unimpacted soils. </li>  
<li> The required pressure can be significant, and once the release of LNAPL to the surface is stopped, the LNAPL body will stabilize at some point on its own accord because the pressure becomes insufficient to drive LNAPL into additional pore spaces. </li>
<li> Recent advances in Natural Source Zone Depletion (NSZD) shows that NSZD is also an important process for limiting LNAPL migration and for stabilizing and even shrinking LNAPL bodies. </li>
</ul>

The figure above shows an example LNAPL body that was released at time 0 and then shows the size of the LNAPL footprint as indicated by monitoring wells over the next three years. The key point is that the footprint of most LNAPL bodies will stabilize after a few years after the release stops. Sale et al. (2018) describe this important point this way:
<br><br>
<i>"A primary concern at LNAPL sites has been the potential for lateral expansion or translation of LNAPL bodies. Fortunately, long-term monitoring suggests that the extent of LNAPL bodies at older LNAPL releases tend to be stable, even when potentially mobile LNAPL exist within the LNAPL bodies (Mahler et al. 2012b). An important exception to stable LNAPL bodies is new releases. Historically, the primary explanation for the stability of older LNAPL releases has been low LNAPL saturation (fractions of pore space containing LNAPL) and correspondingly low formations conductivities to LNAPL. More recently, Mahler et al. (2012a) added the argument that natural loses of LNAPL play a critical role in controlling lateral expansion or translation of LNAPL bodies. In general, the threshold condition for expanding LNAPL bodies, at older release sites, is LNAPL release rates that are greater than natural source zone depletion rates. Much like dissolved phase petroleum hydrocarbon plumes, the extent of LNAPL bodies can be strongly limited by natural processes."</i></h4>
