<h3><b>Introduction: Specific Volume</b></h3>

<h4> In the past, a common misconception of the vertical distribution of free product at the water table was based on the idea that LNAPL occurs as a distinct lens in which the drainable pore space is completely saturated with LNAPL and that the thickness of LNAPL monitoring well accurately represented the thickness of LNAPL in the formation. This was often referred to as the “pancake layer” model for LNAPL, but it does not reflect the important part soil properties play in the relationship between the amount of LNAPL in the formation and the thickness of LNAPL in a well (referred to as "apparent thickness").<br><br>

In the table to the right, the amount of LNAPL in the formation for three different apparent LNAPL thicknesses in a monitoring well is described in terms of a "specific volume." The specific volume is the volume of LNAPL in a given location divided by the area. This is a calculated value of the actual amount of LNAPL present in an area divided by the area. This would be the thickness of LNAPL that would remain in an LNAPL zone if the soil and water in that area were hypothetically removed.<br><br>

For example, if there is one metre of LNAPL measured in a monitoring well screened in a sand, that corresponds to about 0.32 cubic metres (320 liters) of LNAPL per square metre of area. If this well was screened in a silt, there would only be about 0.040 cubic metres (40 liters) of LNAPL per square metre of area. This table shows the relationship between soil type, apparent LNAPL thickness, and the actual amount of LNAPL in the formation per square metre of area.</h4>
