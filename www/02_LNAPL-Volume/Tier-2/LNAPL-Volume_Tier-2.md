<h3> What the Model Does </h3>   

This tool calculates several key LNAPL values, including specific volume, recoverable volume, and transmissivity, at multiple locations for multiple layers of differing soil types. These values are used to calculate a total subsurface LNAPL volume. Based on LNAPL gradients specified by the user, estimated LNAPL velocities are also calculated. The distribution of calculated values are depicted graphically.

<h3> How the Model Works </h3>

The model is based on an extension of the methodology of the API’s LDRM (Charbeneau, 2007). The user enters data into three different databases: 1) a soil parameter database, 2) a well coordinate and fluid level gauging database, and 3) a stratigraphy database. The model determines the layers in which LNAPL is present, then calculates specific volume and other LNAPL parameters for the layered system. Spatial interpolation is used to sum the specific volume at all locations to arrive at a total LNAPL volume.

<h3> Key Assumptions </h3>  

The model assumes that the LNAPL is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the surrounding media. Relative permeability is calculated by combining the Mualum model with the van Genuchten soil characteristic curve parameters (Charbeneau, 2007).

<h3> Developers </h3>  

This LNAPL tool, sometimes referred to as the de Blanc LNAPL Model, was developed by Dr. Phil de Blanc and Dr. Shahla Farhat of GSI Environmental, Houston, Texas.
