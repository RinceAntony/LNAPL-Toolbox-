<b>Computer Models</b>:  Several computer models are available to help understand if LNAPL can be recovered effectively:

<ol>
<li> The <a href="https://www.api.org/oil-and-natural-gas/environment/clean-water/ground-water/lnapl/ldrm" target="_blank">API’s LDRM model</a> can be used to determine how much LNAPL can be recovered. For an overview of LDRM, see Tier 3 of “How much LNAPL is present?” </li>
<li> The <a href="https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=241847" target="_blank">USEPA’s REMFuel</a> model allows users to develop a simple box model of BTEX and oxygenates in an LNAPL source zone, simulate a historical release, and see the effects of removing some fraction of LNAPL in the current timeframe or sometime in the future. For an overview of REMFuel, see Tier 3 of “How long will LNAPL persist?” </li>
<li> The <a href="https://csee.engr.utexas.edu/research/industrial-affiliates-projects/chemical-enhanced-oil-recovery/ut-chem-simulator" target="_blank">UTCHEM model</a> can simulate LNAPL recovery and is particularly useful for extremely complex LNAPL problems and for modeling surfactant remediation projects. For an overview of UTCHEM, see Tier 3 of “How far will LNAPL migrate?” </li>
<li> The <a href="https://www.api.org/oil-and-natural-gas/environment/clean-water/ground-water/lnapl/evaluating-hydrocarbon-removal" target="_blank">API LNAST model</a> can be used to see the impact of LNAPL recovery on dissolved plumes. For an overview of LNAST, see Tier 3 of “How will LNAPL risk change over time?” </li>

<b> LNAPL Transmissivity </b>:  More recently there has a been a move to use LNAPL transmissivity as a key metric to evaluate LNAPL recoverability (e.g., <a href="https://lnapl-3.itrcweb.org/appendix-c-transmissivity-tn-appendix/#1" target="_blank">ITRC, 2017</a>). The ITRC’s “Top Three Things To Know about LNAPL Transmissivity” is reproduced to the right.

The use of transmissivity has been catalyzed by a general consensus that hydraulic recovery of LNAPL (skimmer wells, trenches, groundwater pumping, etc.) has a <b> Technology Threshold Metric </b> consisting of LNAPL transmissivity greater than 0.1 to 0.8 ft2/day (0.0093 to 0.074 m2/day). This metric may be used as a decision point for remedial system operation or technology transitions (<a href="https://lnapl-3.itrcweb.org/appendix-c-transmissivity-tn-appendix/" target="_blank">ITRC, 2018</a>). For example, in the State of Michigan, LNAPL guidance states <i>“if the NAPL has a transmissivity greater than 0.5 ft2/day, it is likely that the NAPL can be recovered in a cost-effective and efficient manner unless a demonstration is made to show otherwise.”</i> (<a href="https://lnapl-3.itrcweb.org/appendix-c-transmissivity-tn-appendix/" target="_blank">ITRC, 2018</a>). ITRC also describes five sites in detail that were used as the basis of this range (Section 1.3).

LNAPL transmissivity can be determined in two general ways:

<ol>
<li> Computer Models:  Using a multiphase LNAPL model to calculate transmissivity based on soil type, LNAPL properties, and other factors. The Tier 2 LNAPL Subsurface Volume and Extent Model can be used to easily estimate LNAPL transmissivity, as can LDRM. <a href="https://www.api.org/oil-and-natural-gas/environment/clean-water/ground-water/lnapl/~/media/97D9B7561D34477F85D790DC1E3CCDBB.ashx" target="_blank">Sale (2001)</a> provide methods for determining inputs to environmental petroleum hydrocarbon and recovery models. </li>

<li> Field Measurements (<a href="https://lnapl-3.itrcweb.org/appendix-c-transmissivity-tn-appendix/" target="_blank">ITRC, 2018</a>, Section 2.0):  Conduct field data and analyze the data to calculate the LNAPL transmissivity. <a href="https://lnapl-3.itrcweb.org/appendix-c-transmissivity-tn-appendix/" target="_blank">ITRC (2018)</a> and <a href="https://www.astm.org/Standards/E2856.htm" target="_blank">ASTM (2013)</a> prescribe three approaches: </li>
<ol>
<li> <i>LNAPL Baildown Testing.</i>  Note a computer spreadsheet is available to process the data from baildown tests to determine transmissivity (<a href="https://www.api.org/oil-and-natural-gas/environment/clean-water/ground-water/lnapl/transmissivity-workbook" target="_blank">Charbeneau et al., 2012</a>) (no metric units, however). </li>

<li> <i>Manual LNAPL Skimming Testing.</i> </li>

<li> <i>LNAPL Recovery System Evaluation.</i> </li>
