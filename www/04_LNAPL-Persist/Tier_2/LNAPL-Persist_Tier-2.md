<h3> What the Model Does </h3>   
This simple LNAPL lifetime calculator shows two different models of how NSZD will remove LNAPL over time.
*	The left graph shows a “zero order” NSZD model where the current NSZD rate stays constant over a long period of time, as suggested by Garg et al. (2017) (see excerpt below).
*	The right graphs shows a “first order” NSZD model where the current NSZD rate drops in proportion to the mass of LNAPL remaining.  Many natural attenuation models assume this type of relationship (e.g., BIOSCREEN model, Newell et al., 1996).

<h3> How the Model Works </h3>

Given an initial LNAPL body volume and NSZD rate (either via an NSZD study in the field or a using typical NSZD rates in the scientific literature), the model calculates an estimate range when most/all of the LNAPL will be removed by NSZD.

<h3> Key Assumptions </h3>  

The model assumes the user has an estimate of the LNAPL volume remaining in the subsurface (in volume units of total liters of LNAPL in the source zone) and has an estimate for the NSZD rates. Current knowledge suggests that a zero-order depletion rate can be assumed for much of the life of the LNAPL until a low saturation of LNAPL or a relatively recalcitrant fraction is left, but research is needed to determine if this fraction should be considered important for site management, for example, its magnitude and any persisting secondary water quality effects.

Overall, the linear model will present a best-case estimate for the LNAPL lifetime, and the first order model will be more conservative (i.e., may overestimate the LNAPL lifetime).
