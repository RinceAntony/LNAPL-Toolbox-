<h4>If the intersection of the two values for the X- and Y-axes are to the right of the line for your LNAPL type, it suggests that LNAPL is potentially recoverable (see Example 1 for gasoline below, this point is to the right of the gasoline line and therefore may be recoverable). <br><br>
If the intersection of the two values for the X- and Y-axes are to the left of the line for your LNAPL type, it suggests that LNAPL is likely not recoverable (see Example 2 for Fuel Oil #4 below, this point is to the left of the Fuel Oil #4 line and therefore is less likely to be recoverable).</h4>
