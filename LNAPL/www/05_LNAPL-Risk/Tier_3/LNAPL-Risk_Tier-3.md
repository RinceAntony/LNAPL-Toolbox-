The risk posed by the toxic components of an LNAPL plume is a function of the constituents’ concentration in groundwater in contact with the LNAPL. A multi-component LNAPL dissolution model based on the LNAPL constituent mole fraction and Raoult’s law (<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1029/WM017" target="_blank">Mayer and Hassanizadeh, 2005</a>) is provided in Tier 2 and shows how the dissolved constituent concentrations immediately downgradient of an LNAPL body change over time.

A more sophisticated computer tool, <a href="https://www.api.org/oil-and-natural-gas/environment/clean-water/ground-water/lnapl/evaluating-hydrocarbon-removal" target="_blank">API’s LNAST model</a>, also shows the change in dissolved phase LNAPL concentrations over time (<a href="https://www.api.org/oil-and-natural-gas/environment/clean-water/ground-water/lnapl/evaluating-hydrocarbon-removal" target="_blank">Huntley and Beckett, 2002</a>). It is summarized below. Finally, two other key LNAPL attenuation studies, a LNAPL mass balance developed by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169772214000618?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Ng et al. (2014)</a> and a <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a369582.pdf" target="_blank">2003 report</a> about weathering of jet fuel LNAPL, are also reviewed below.

<h3><b> Overview of API’s LNAPL Dissolution and Transport Screening Tool (LNAST) </b></h3>

<ul>
<li> LNAST is suite of calculation tools, information about LNAPL, and LNAPL parameter databases. LNAST focuses on LNAPL distribution and fate at the water table. The calculation tool part of LNAST:
<li> Predicts LNAPL distribution, dissolution, and volatilization over time. </li>
<li> Calculates downgradient dissolved-phase concentration through time. </li>
<li> Shows results both with and without hydraulic recovery of LNAPL. </li>
<li> Simulates the smear zone and the downgradient dissolved plume. </li>
<li> Combines multi-phase transport, dissolution, and solute transport. </li>
<li> Accounts for relative permeability effects caused by LNAPL. </li>
<li> Zones of high LNAPL saturation have much less groundwater flow through them, extending the longevity of these zones. </li>
<li> Good tool for estimating how long an LNAPL-generated plume will persist. </li>
<li> Powerful tool to see if LNAPL recovery reduces the longevity of the source and plume. </li>
<li> Key output is concentration of dissolved constituents in the plume vs. time at an observation well. </li>
<li> Does not account for Natural Source Zone Depletion (NSZD). </li>
<li> Assumes that remediation occurs shortly after the LNAPL release. You cannot release LNAPL many years ago and then start the remediation now a few decades later. The <a href="https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=241847" target="_blank">REMFuel model</a> will do this, see Tier 3 of “How long will LNAPL persist?” portion of the Concawe LNAPL Toolbox. </li>

<h3><b> Checklist of Input Data for LNAST </b></h3>

To use LNAST, the user first indicates the information desired from the tool:

<p align="center">
<img src="./05_LNAPL-Risk/Tier_3/images/Picture1.png">
</p><br><br>

The tool then takes the user through a series of eight input screens to define soil properties, groundwater conditions, source area parameters, LNAPL properties, and solute transport.

<h3><b> Description of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169772214000618?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Ng et al. (2014)</a> LNAPL Model </b></h3>

<ul>
<li> A reactive transport model of an LNAPL body was developed by Ng et al. to simulate a 1979 LNAPL release at what is now the National Crude Oil Spill Research Site. </li>
<li> The model was based on extensive research conducted by the USGS and several universities to construct the model. </li>
<li> As shown in the figure below developed by <a href="https://ngwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gwmr.12219" target="_blank">Garg et al. (2017)</a>, Ng et al. developed a mass balance around five “buckets”:  BEX, toluene, short-chained alkanes, long-chained alkanes, and pre-NVDOC (non-volatile dissolved organic carbon). </li>
<li>	The figure shows the percent depleted of each bucket in 27 years (green values), the contribution to the NSZD rate (red values), the rate of biodegradation of each bucket (blue arrows), and an inhibition term (red arrows). </li>
</ul>

<p align="center">

</p><br><br>

<img style="float: right;" src="./05_LNAPL-Risk/Tier_3/images/Picture16.png">
<br><br><br><br>
<ul>
<li> The Ng et al. model was used to simulate LNAPL composition from the 1979 to the year 2079 as shown to the right (<a href="https://ngwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gwmr.12219" target="_blank">Garg et al. 2017</a>). </li>
<br><br>
<li> It assumed the “overall NSZD rate is approximately constant over time (pseudo-zero order), because the main contributors to NSZD, the short-chained and long-chained alkanes, are represented as a first-order decay rate where the biodegradation rate for these two constituent ‘buckets’ gets smaller over time. As they do, the inhibition effect on the pre-NVDOC bucket defined by Ng et al. (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169772214000618?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">2014</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2015WR016964" target="_blank">2015</a>) diminishes and the pre-NVDOC starts to biodegrade and ‘take up the slack’ for the declining alkane degradation rate to produce a relatively constant biodegradation rate for much of the site history.” (<a href="https://ngwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gwmr.12219" target="_blank">Garg et al. 2017</a>). </li>
<br><br>
<li> Overall, “the detailed reactive transport model developed by Ng et al. (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169772214000618?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">2014</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2015WR016964" target="_blank">2015</a>) was adapted to explore LNAPL composition change as a result of NSZD. This model suggests that methanogenic microorganisms consume different LNAPL constituents/chemical classes in a semi-sequential basis due to inhibition and other effects, which then can produce quasizero- order bulk NSZD rates over long time periods” (<a href="https://ngwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gwmr.12219" target="_blank">Garg et al. 2017</a>). </li>

<h3><b> Parsons Fuel LNAPL Weathering Study </b></h3>

<ul>
<li> Study of 12 LNAPL sites where data on concentration of BTEX constituents in LNAPL (as weight percent) vs. time (over the span of several years) in LNAPL source zones was compiled (<a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a369582.pdf" target="_blank">Parsons et al., 2003</a>). Jet fuel (JP-4) was the LNAPL found at most of these sites. </li><br><br>
<li> “Free-phase fuel BTEX weathering rates will vary from site to site and are influenced by many factors including spill age, the relative solubility of individual compounds, free product geometry, and the rate at which groundwater and precipitation contacts LNAPL.” </li><br><br>
<li> “…the average total BTEX, first-order weathering rate for five JP-4 sites is approximately 16 %/yr. Based on all of the data collected, this appears to be a reasonable default value for estimating total BTEX weathering from JP-4 LNAPL.” </li><br><br>
<li> “As predicted by their relatively high solubilities, benzene and toluene exhibit higher weathering rates than ethylbenzene and xylenes. Because benzene is a known human carcinogen with a federal MCL of 5 μg/L, benzene weathering rates will generally determine the timeframe for fuel spill remediation.” “Based on Figure 5.4, the average benzene first-order weathering rate for five JP-4 sites is approximately 26 %/yr. Based on all of the data collected, this appears to be a reasonable default value for estimating benzene weathering from JP 4 LNAPL.” </li>
