Natural Source Zone Depletion (NSZD) has emerged as an important new remediation alternative for LNAPL sites. Key references and a description of what they explain about NSZD are provided below:

<ul>
<li> The ITRC’s (2018) <a href="https://lnapl-3.itrcweb.org/appendix-b-natural-source-zone-depletion-nszd-appendix/" target="_blank">LNAPL Site Management—LCSM Evolution, Decision Process, and Remedial Technologies</a> guidance is heavily influenced by the developments in measuring and applying NSZD for LNAPL site management, with over 100 specific mentions of NSZD in the document and a detailed <a href="https://lnapl-3.itrcweb.org/appendix-b-natural-source-zone-depletion-nszd-appendix/#exec_sum" target="_blank">NSZD appendix</a>. More importantly, it provides detailed information on three frequently used NSZD assessment methods: </li>
<ul>
<li> The gradient method, based on soil gas composition,  </li>
<li> Carbon dioxide flux-based methods, including Carbon Traps and dynamic closed flux chambers (i.e. DCC-LI-COR), and  </li>
<li> The biogenic heat monitoring method (Thermal Monitoring).  </li>
</ul>

<li>	Key vendors for these methods are: </li><ul>

It is based on roughly 100 technical references. </li>

<li>	ESTCP’s <a href= "https://www.enviro.wiki/index.php?title=Natural_Source_Zone_Depletion_(NSZD)" target="_blank">Environmental Wiki</a> has an entry describing NSZD where the significance of NSZD is discussed along with NSZD stoichiometry, the gaseous expression of NSZD through gas evolution, and measuring temperature to determine NSZD (<a href= "https://www.enviro.wiki/index.php?title=Natural_Source_Zone_Depletion_(NSZD)" target="_blank">Palaia, T., J. Fitzgibbons, and P. Kulkarni, 2019</a>). </li>

The document applies to hydrocarbon sites that have a need for theoretical, qualitative, or quantitative understanding of NSZD processes. Its Appendix B contains a checklist for practitioners. </li>

<h3><b> Videos about NSZD </b></h3>

Two videos were developed for the NSZD article in the ESTCP <a href= "https://www.enviro.wiki/index.php?title=Natural_Source_Zone_Depletion_(NSZD)" target="_blank">Environmental Wiki</a>. They can be viewed here:
<ul>
<li> <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KF1uRIOZoQ" target="_blank">Carbon Traps NSZD</a> </li>

<h3><b> What NSZD Rates are Seen at Hydrocarbon Sites? </b></h3>

The following table from <a href= "https://ngwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gwmr.12219" target="_blank">Garg et al. (2017)</a> summarizes measured NSZD rates at various hydrocarbon sites in the U.S. The middle 50% of the NSZD rates range from 700 – 2,800 gallons per acre per year.
