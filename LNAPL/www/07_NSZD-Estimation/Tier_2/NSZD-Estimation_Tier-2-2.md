<h3> NSZD Rate Converter </h3>   

<h3> What the Model Does </h3>   

NSZD rates are typically reported in units of volume of LNAPL biodegraded per area per time, such as “gallons per acre per year” in some of the NSZD projects performed in the United States.  This model converts typical measures of NSZD rates between metric and imperial, as well as converting from carbon dioxide flux to mass or volume of LNAPL degraded per area per time (ex. Liters of LNAPL biodegraded per hectare per year).

<h3> How the Model Works </h3>

The user is able to select an LNAPL type or representative compound, enter an NSZD value and select starting units, and select a final desired unit of mass or volume of LNAPL degradation.

<h3> Key Assumptions </h3>  

For converting from a carbon dioxide flux in units of µmol/m<sup>2</sup>/sec to an LNAPL volume or mass per area per time, the table below summarizes densities and molecular weights applied for each LNAPL type or representative compound. Note that default parameters apply the density of fresh gasoline (0.77 g/mL), and the molecular weight of octane (114.2 g/mol).
