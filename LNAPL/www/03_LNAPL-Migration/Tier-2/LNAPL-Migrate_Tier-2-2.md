<h3> Mahler LNAPL Migration Model </h3> 

<h3> What the Model Does </h3>   

Methods developed by Mahler et al. (2012) illustrate that natural losses of LNAPL (e.g., NSZD) can play an important role in governing the overall extent of LNAPL bodies.  This module calculates the overall length of a contiguous LNAPL body, given an inflow of LNAPL rate, NSZD rate, and time period.

<h3> How the Model Works </h3>

The user is able to select a Long-Term LNAPL Release Rate, NSZD Rate, and a Time Period of Model. The output is an estimated ultimate LNAPL body length.

<h3> Key Assumptions </h3>  

A limitation of the current methodology is the assumption of constant inflow of LNAPL throughout the entire lifetime of the LNAPL Body. Given either the reduction or termination of an LNAPL body, the times for stabilization and LNAPL body length could be much shorter. Additionally, LNAPL migration is not a function of the slope of the water table. Finally, the tool is limited to three different selections for the Long-term LNAPL Release Rate, three different selections for NSZD Rate, and three different selections for Time Period.
